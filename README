NetflixCatalog
==============

This is a very simple plugin that will pull back info about a catalog item (i.e. a film) from Netflix.

A lot of the code comes from flix4r. I just updated it to have more film info and make actors (and directors) objects, not just strings.


Example
=======

./script/plugin install 

should create a netflix_credentials.yml in your config that you need to fill out with your key and secret (available from netflix at 
http://developers.netflix.com)

Call:

list = NetFlix::Title.search(:term => 'the spirit', :max_results => 2)
